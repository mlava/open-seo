# Papercuts

Small, non-blocking friction in the repository itself — the kind that will
waste the next contributor's time too. Log it in the moment; review and fix
entries in a separate, user-requested cleanup pass.

This is not a completed-work log, a bug tracker, or a place for the agent's own
sandbox/shell/network hiccups. Never include secrets, credentials, personal
data, or sensitive paths.

## Open

- [ ] `2026-08-06T23:10:04Z` — `claude` — `pnpm db:generate` aborts with "Interactive prompts require a TTY terminal" whenever one table both drops and adds a column in the same change: drizzle-kit can't tell a drop+add from a rename and asks. That makes the script unusable non-interactively (CI, agents, piped shells). Workaround is to split the change into two passes — generate the additions first, then the drop — which also yields a cleaner migration history. Worth documenting next to the `db:generate` scripts so the next person doesn't have to rediscover it.
- [ ] `2026-07-29T22:52:00Z` — `claude` — `pnpm knip` fails with hundreds of bogus "unused files" once a git worktree exists under `.claude/worktrees/` (the path `EnterWorktree` uses): it walks the nested checkout and counts every file in it. `.gitignore` covers the directory but knip's `ignore` in `knip.jsonc` does not. Same root cause as the `.code-review-graph` entry below — repo tooling scans agent-created local directories. Adding `.claude/worktrees/**` to `knip.jsonc`'s `ignore` fixes it.
- [ ] `2026-07-29T22:39:31Z` — `claude` — `pnpm ci:check` dies at `prettier --check .` with `ENOENT ... .code-review-graph/graph.db-shm` / `-wal`: the code-review-graph MCP server's SQLite WAL files appear and vanish mid-run, and `.prettierignore` has no entry for that directory (`.gitignore` does, but Prettier doesn't read it). Because `ci:check` chains with `&&`, knip/tsc/oxlint never run, so the failure looks unrelated to formatting — the same trap as the resolved `cf-resources.json` entry below. Adding `.code-review-graph/` to `.prettierignore` fixes it.
- [ ] `2026-07-20T20:08:28Z` — `claude` — In a fresh git worktree, `oxlint --type-aware` crashes with `Cannot find module '@oxlint/binding-darwin-arm64'` — the platform-specific optional dep is missing from the worktree's node_modules while tsc/prettier work fine, and plain `pnpm install` reports up-to-date without restoring it; `pnpm install --force` (~22s) fixes it. Worth making the worktree-setup hook (or a documented step) run the forced install so lint doesn't die on fresh worktrees.
- [ ] `2026-07-19T04:06:52Z` — `codex` — `pnpm --dir web build` fails with `vite: command not found` when `web/node_modules` is absent, despite the root toolchain being installed. Document or enforce the package-local install required before validating the `web/` subpackage.
- [ ] `2026-07-19T02:55:56Z` — `claude` — Adding a docs folder under `web/content/docs` whose `meta.json` lists an `[Overview](...)` link renders a duplicated, double-highlighted sidebar entry, because the folder-index strip in `web/src/lib/source.ts` (`transformPageTree.folder`) is a per-folder-name allowlist. Derive it from the meta convention (or strip the index for all folders) so new sections don't need a hidden source.ts edit.
- [ ] `2026-07-14T01:28:30Z` — `claude` — Regenerating the lockfile (adding or moving a dep) makes `pnpm install` re-run the `minimumReleaseAge` gate on transitive peers already pinned at that exact version (`mysql2`, `sql-escaper`, `@aws-sdk/credential-providers`), failing the install even though nothing about them changed. `pnpm install --config.minimumReleaseAge=0` — then confirm the lockfile diff stays version-neutral — unblocks it; worth documenting that regen step so the gate doesn't re-block already-pinned versions.
- [ ] `2026-07-10T21:28:46Z` — `codex` — `pnpm --dir badseo run typecheck` works through the root toolchain but `pnpm --dir badseo run build` can't find Vite because `badseo/node_modules` is absent. Document or enforce the package-local install before validating the `badseo/` subpackage.
- [ ] `2026-07-10T21:32:10Z` — `codex` — Formatting the `badseo/` workspace with `pnpm exec prettier` fails because Prettier is only available from the repository root. Document the root-only formatter command or expose a workspace-local formatting script.

- [x] `2026-07-25T08:15:00Z` — `claude` — `npm run ci:check` failed on a clean checkout of `main`: `cf-selfhost-deploy.sh` writes `cf-resources.json` as a single line of JSON, that file was tracked, and `prettier --check .` rejected it — and because `ci:check` chains with `&&`, knip/tsc/oxlint never ran, so the failure looked unrelated to formatting. Fixed by gitignoring and untracking the generated file rather than reformatting it (a reformat would be undone by the next deploy). Resolved 2026-07-25 in `ce164d7`.
